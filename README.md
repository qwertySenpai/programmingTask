For purpose of this task, you will find two implemented functions:

Fibonacci Calculation:
This function calculates 'n-th' fibonacci of given number 'n' as parameter. It will check if the input is
an positive integer. For calculation a recursive function is used.

Excluding Repeating Words:
This function will give an output of given words as prompt input excluding repeating words.
First, the user is asked to input an integer greater than 0 for number of expecting inputs (otherwise it will give a warning text).
Second, the user is asked to input any word (only alphabetical characters are allowed!).
Third, the word will be appended into a list only if not already existing.
Finally, the word list will be printed as an output.
